## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Story Engine Core**: Implemented a deterministic state machine on Node B for tracking narrative state (Arc, Beat, Event) based on the `kingbootoshi/story-engine` pattern.
- **Afterlife Night Market**: Implemented the `NightMarketService` on Node B with RAG-driven inventory querying from the `campaign_ttta` namespace.
- **Eagle Economy**: Added the "Eagle" conversion logic (100eb=0.5, 500eb=3, 1000eb=7.5) as defined in the TTTA spec.
- **GM Approval Queue**: Implemented a human-in-the-loop interceptor in `src/core/gm-approval-queue.ts` that pauses state mutations for GM confirmation.
- **Interactive Foundry UI**: Expanded `foundry-api-bridge.js` with native `Dialog` components for the Night Market storefront and the GM Approval flow.
- **Bridge Protocol Expansion**: Added `buy_item`, `approval_response`, `update_actor`, `queue_approval`, and `open_night_market` commands/events to the bridge protocol with strict Zod validation.
- **TDD Rigor**: Achieved 228 passing tests with new suites for all Phase 4 components.

### Changed
- Refactored `HybridRoutingController` to orchestrate the new E2E simulation loop (Gig -> Roll -> Trade -> Beat).
- Updated `FoundryAdapter` with `updateActor` and `openNightMarket` methods.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Node A Remediation**: Restored Dockerized PostgreSQL connectivity, initialized pgvector schema, and enabled `vector`/`pgcrypto` extensions.
- **Rules Ingestion**: Successfully seeded 1,437 rule and lore chunks from Node B to Node A.
- **Node A Source Sync**: Synchronized `src/` to Node A, enabling remote execution of Rules Authority logic.
- **Zero-Trust Hardening**: Implemented manual Zod validation in `nitro-db` MCP server to ensure protocol integrity.
- **Phase 4 Pre-flight Audit**: Stabilized `phase4-preflight.ts` with local transport and better error handling; achieved 🟢 100% success rate.

### Changed
- Standardized environment variables across all scripts via `dotenv`.
